          I am a passionate software developer specializing in both front end
          and back-end development, with a keen focus on AI integration.
          Proficient in React.js, Django, and Express.js, I build dynamic,
          responsive, and scalable web applications. My experience includes
          hands-on integration of AI models like OpenAIâ€™s GPT, Claude, and AWS
          Titan to enable intelligent automation and enhance user experiences.
          Driven by innovation, I am committed to merging cutting-edge AI
          technologies with intuitive design to deliver powerful, user-centric
          solutions.

          When I'm not coding, you can find me contributing to open-source
          projects, or exploring new technologies.
